      Hey there, thanks for stopping by my profile!

For the TL;DR peeps:

I help brands win hearts. Main strengths: copy and strategy. Wanna e-meet over coffee? I'm always down to connect and explore new opportunities.

The longer version:

I specialize in solving brand messaging and strategy challenges for any business that believes in what they do. Whether you’re just starting out or stepping up, I can help you re(launch) or (re)brand the right way.

In the last 7 years, I also helped my clients get in front of The Times, Huffington Post, Google I/O, and Entrepreneur audiences, to name a few.

A lot of brands I work with have raked up all sorts of awards in their respective industries. Though I cannot take sole credit for any of those, it sure feels good to be part of mega-success stories every now and then. 

Some brand names my work has been associated with are: Microsoft, Digicel, Marriott Bonvoy, and Dash Digital Cash.

I am driven by the mantra "work smart at working hard".

If you asked any number of people who've worked with me over the years to describe me, I'm sure "robot" and "workaholic" are words to come up. Now, I'm not gonna confirm nor deny these, but I do prefer the term "passionate workaholic", just to be clear.

The job that I do is a never-ending one. It requires passion and effort of the ultimate kind. Imagine you were married to someone named Creativity. Yup, that's my life.

If you're interested in linking up, please always feel free to reach out. 

Full disclosure: if you're selling me something 5 seconds into me clicking that 'Accept' button, you're getting blocked, reported, avoided, and sent into the deepest abyss of Linkedin oblivion. Not kidding!

On the bright side...

If you're looking to work together, please know that I expect us to “put in the work”. I will respect your time and your business, and I expect the same in return. I'm the kind of guy who is ready to take your call at 4am in the morning, who will believe in you, motivate you, teach you, shout at you, and re-re-repeat certain things if need be. 

So, dear Linkedin connections, brands, coaches, corporations... If I'm your kind of guy, feel free to let me know. My coffee machine is always ready to get fired up.

Oh, and I also proudly boast the title of an award-winning, internationally experienced EFL teacher... in case anyone cares where my anglo-skills come from.

Thanks for reading up until here. You're amazing!

Cheers,
Jay
